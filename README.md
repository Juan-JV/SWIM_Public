# Flight Trajectory Prediction with the System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) Data

In this project, we build two Bayesian neural networks to predict the trajectory of ongoing flight. The first model is built with feedforward neural network with the goal to predict flight trajectory deviation from flight plan, while the second model is built with the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to make longer-term prediction on flight trajectory. The two models are combined to achieve high prediction accuracy and longer-term prediction capability. The uncertainty in both models is chracterized following Bayesian approach and implemented with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. 

## Getting Started

This repository is used to show the detailed procedures in the development of deep learning models, where the flight AA598 is used as an illustrative example. The trajectory of flight AA598 has been preprocessed to remove anamous data, and the missing data has been imputed with linear interpolation. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
